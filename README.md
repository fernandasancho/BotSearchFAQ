<h1>Search Your Knowledge Base</h1>

In this recipe, we learn how to search our Knowledge base and return those results to the customer.
Knowledge article search is a popular use case for chatbots. With Apex actions and dynamic menus, we can come up with a basic solution.
The bot asks for a keyword with a <b>Question</b> element, passes the keyword to an Apex action, and then the Apex method performs a SOSL search to return a list of articles. 
If the customer wants more detail, you can merge article content in the response.

While thatâ€™s a basic design that serves as a starting point, consider the user experience.
Given the limited real estate in a chat window, a typical user interface shows only a snippet of an article. If a customer wants more, they can click a link and open the article in a browser window. 

<h3>1. Create an invocable Apex method to search articles. </h3>
